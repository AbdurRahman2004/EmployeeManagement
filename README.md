# Employee Management System

This project is an **Employee Management System** built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend. It allows organizations to manage employee records, including details like name, employee ID, date of birth, gender, marital status, department, and profile image.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Admin users can log in to the system and manage employee details.
- **CRUD Operations for Employees**: Add, update, view, and delete employee records.
- **File Upload**: Upload employee profile images that are stored temporarily during the session.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is fully responsive, built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Axios, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Multer (for file uploads)
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT)
- **File Storage**: Temporary file storage using Vercel's `/tmp` directory (local development) or cloud-based storage (recommended for production)
